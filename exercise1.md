If it is a C# application, setting up CI steps is surprisingly straightforward, thanks to the .NET ecosystem’s robust built-in tools that streamline almost every part of the process.

When preparing for a release, code linting and style enforcement start with `dotnet format` tool that automatically aligns code with team standards, using configurations defined in the `.editorconfig` file. This ensures consistent formatting across the team without manual checks. For testing, C# offers a range of mature frameworks: NUnit for flexible test structuring, `MSTest` as Microsoft’s official option, `NUnit`, `TUnit` and `xUnit.v3` as community support, concise test cases. All these frameworks integrate seamlessly with `dotnet test`, a command that runs tests, generates reports, and even checks coverage when paired with tools like `Coverlet`. Building is equally simplified: `dotnet build` parses project files (e.g., `.csproj`), resolves NuGet dependencies, and compiles code—eliminating the need for complex build scripts.

Beyond Jenkins and GitHub Actions, several alternatives stand out. Travis CI, a longstanding tool, offers both cloud-hosted plans for quick setup and enterprise self-hosted versions for on-premises control. GitLab CI/CD is a strong all-in-one choice, combining code hosting and CI/CD in a single platform (available both cloud and on-premises), making it a solid GitHub alternative. Major cloud providers also offer tailored solutions: AWS CodePipeline, Azure Pipelines and etc.

For a 6-person team, cloud-based CI is typically ideal. It reduces infrastructure maintenance, scales on demand, and avoids upfront hardware costs. However, self-hosting makes sense in three scenarios: strict security or compliance needs, heavy CPU/GPU demands, or highly frequent builds.
